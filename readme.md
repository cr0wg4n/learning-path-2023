# My learning path for 2023

To understand what will happen with this new year in terms of technology, we need to realize what happened last year.

* The IA topic introduced a new brand universe of possibilities for content creation.
* Is crypto death?
* New blazingly fast tools were presented as an alternative to others with lower performance (built with @rust-lang).
* DevOps is gaining more adepts and enthusiasts.
* New fields and tools for data science: data, visualization, decision-making, bussines and profit.
* IoT was not in the top-notch news.
* As always, other topics like systems programming, hardware hacking, IA modeling, performing, and secure focus for web apps; are specific fields with depth and fundamental concepts.

I don't know how to start this year, but as always I will try to learn Rust again and again, it is really hard for me. So, in this new year I will try to learn:

* Algorithms, data structures, and software architecture.
* TypeScript in depth (Javascript depth fundamentals to understand what turns really great TS).
* The true meaning behind FLOSS and hacktivism.
* What is behind our modern frontend frameworks (angular, vue, and react)
* Depth concepts about network and internet:
  * Protocols:
    * telnet
    * FTP
    * TCP/UDP
    * HTTP/HTTPS
    * SSL
    * SSH
    * onion
* Hardware programming:
  * To understand C/C++ logic
  * Concurrency or RTOS
  * C/C++ pure interaction with GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART.
* Linux Kernel
* Reversing
  * Java Applications
  * Binaries in general
* GRPC
* Rabbitmq
* Rust (with a background of C/C++)

I'll try to put my results (code, thoughts, and doubts) here.

## What I've learned?

*This space will be filled (someday of this year)*


## I think is... What do you think?

*This space will be filled (someday of this year)*

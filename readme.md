# My learning path for 2023

To understand what will happen with this new year in terms of technology, we need to realize what happened last year.

* The IA topic introduced a new brand universe of possibilities for content creation.
* Is crypto death?
* New blazingly fast tools were presented as an alternative to others with lower performance (built with @rust-lang).
* DevOps is gaining more adepts and enthusiasts.
* New fields and tools for data science: data, visualization, decision-making, bussines and profit.
* IoT was not in the top-notch news.
* As always, other topics like systems programming, hardware hacking, IA modeling, performing, and secure focus for web apps; are specific fields with depth and fundamental concepts.

I don't know how to start this year, but as always I will try to learn Rust again and again, it is really hard for me. So, in this new year I will try to learn:

* Algorithms, data structures, and software architecture.
* TypeScript in depth (Javascript depth fundamentals to understand what turns really great TS).
* The true meaning behind FLOSS and hacktivism.
* What is behind our modern frontend frameworks (angular, vue, and react)
* Depth concepts about network and internet:
  * Protocols:
    * telnet
    * FTP
    * TCP/UDP
    * HTTP/HTTPS
    * DNS
    * SSL
    * SSH
    * SMTP
    * onion
* Hardware programming:
  * To understand C/C++ logic
  * Concurrency or RTOS
  * C/C++ pure interaction with GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART.
* Linux Kernel
* Reversing
  * Java Applications
  * Binaries in general
* GRPC
* Rabbitmq
* Rust (with a background of C/C++)

I'll try to put my results (code, thoughts, and doubts) here.

## What I've learned?

*This space will be filled (someday of this year)*


## I think is... What do you think?

*This space will be filled (someday of this year)*


## To get a job (as a Frontend Developer)
There are tons of frontend js frameworks right now, but the industry tends to use the popular ones because popular means more resources, community, support, and so on.

So, I'll practice the following:
* React / Next
* Angular

More and more projects tend to use TS as the principal language because it guarantees safety and maintainability in some cases.

To test frontend applications, there are some tools:
* Playwright / Cypress
* Jest 
* Storybook

For desing and UI colaboration:
* Figma
